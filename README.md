# Online_retail_customer_segmentation

Description:
This project focused on segmenting customers in an online retail dataset using their purchase history and behaviors. The goal was to cluster customers into distinct groups to allow for more targeted marketing efforts and personalized customer experiences.

Algorithms/Techniques Used:
K-Means Clustering: Applied to group customers based on purchase behavior.
Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis: This technique helped define the key metrics for clustering.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Used for dimensionality reduction to improve the clustering process.

Conclusion:
The segmentation analysis identified several distinct customer segments:

High-value frequent buyers: Customers who frequently purchase expensive items.
Occasional buyers: Customers who make infrequent but high-value purchases.
Bargain hunters: Customers focused on buying items on sale or with discounts. These segments allow the retail company to craft personalized marketing campaigns, driving customer engagement and loyalty while maximizing sales.
